# Shadow of War Debugging Tool
**Description**: Wrote this code over a year ago to originally reverse engineer the save file format. Ended up just helping the Shadow of War community with their understanding of the Nemesis system.

I don't have much plans to continue working on this project, but I will still accept pull requests if you want to add something.
